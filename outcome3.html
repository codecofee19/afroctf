        <h1>Outcome: Expulsion</h1>
       <P> Your friend used the bug to use to raise their grade. However, the next day, both of you are called into the principal's office. Your teacher is there. The principal explains that your friend was caught using the teacher's password and unfairly changing grades. The principal says you told your friend about the bug, and you didn't tell the teacher instead. You are expelled. It's tempting to do things that help those we care about in the moment. However, the other students and teacher were affected by your friend's decision. When we fail to be honest to those around us, there can be serious consequences that affect us for life. Even when no one is watching, it's alwyas important to make great decisions. Let's try again and make great decisions!  </P>
