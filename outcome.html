        <h1>Outcome</h1>
       <P> You didn't tell anyone. However, the bug is not known. This means another student or anyone else could change the grades. They could make hard-working students fail the class, or they raise their grades earning them. It's always important to make smart decisions even when no one is looking. While you may not get into trouble for not speaking out about the bug, there are dangerous long-term consequences for the teacher and the entire class. Don't worry! This game is meant to teach you about making good decisions. You have a chance to try again and choose a better path. </P>
