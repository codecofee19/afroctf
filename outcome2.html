       <P> Good job! You've told the teacher, and now she knows about the issue. She can have the tech support fix it. She thanks you a lot for telling her. Even though you could've used the password for yourself, you decided to make a great decision for the benefit of the class and entire school! Sometimes we have to take into account how our decisions affects others, and that helps us make better decisions. </P>
