       <P> You tell a friend. They tell you should use it. Your friend tells you, "I know you've been struggling in this class. Just raise your grade a little so it's not too obvious that you're cheating. And if you're not going to use it, give it to me and I'll use it to raise my grade. I've been failing for the longest time." Should you use it to raise your grade or help your friend instead? </P>
