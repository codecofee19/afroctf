        <p>When you browse the internet, every website you have visit has an address. It looks like a bunch of random numbers like <code>154.13.415.431</code></p>
        <p>These numbers are called IP Addresses or internet protocol addresses. Kind of like a home address but for computers.</p>
        <p>Your computer converts domain names like google.com and facebook.com to these special numbers because facebook.com is <i>a lot</i> easier to remember
    than <code>151.31.415.51</code>.</p>
        <p>See if you can find the address of <strong>austintexas.gov</strong> using this <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx" target="_blank">website</a>. Enter it to continue.</p>
        <form>
        <input id="ipaddr" type="text" placeholder="Enter IP address here"></input>
        <button id="enter">Enter</button>
        </form>
        <div class="hidden">
            <h2>Nice Job! ðŸŽ‰</h2>
            <p>Why would an attacker care about IP addresses? Well, the first step to attacking a website is knowing where it is. With an IP address a hacker could look for openings. This is a huge topic but attackers mostly try to find what kind of software is running on a website. Old software can sometimes be exploited so remember to keep your computer up to date!</p>
