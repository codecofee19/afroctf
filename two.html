    <h1>AfroCTF Challenge 2!</h1>
    <p>When you browse the internet, every website you have visit has an address. It looks like a bunch of random numbers like 154.13.415.431</p>
    <p>These numbers are called IP Addresses or internet protocol addresses. Kind of like a home address but for computers.</p>
    <p>Your computer converts domain names like google.com and facebook.com to these special numbers because facebook.com is ALOT easier to remember
than 151.31.415.51</p>
    <p>See if you can find the address of austintexas.gov using this <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx" target="_blank">website</a>. Enter it to continue.</p>
