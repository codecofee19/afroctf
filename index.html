      <h1>Welcome to AfroCTF!</h1>
      <p>Did you know that all pages are made of a special language called HTML? Your first challenge is taking a look under the hood of this web page. Let's uncover the secret password to continue.</p> 
      <p>Right-click on this page and click on <code>View Page Source</code>. You'll see a bunch of text that looks like this:</p>
      <img src="inspect.png"/>
      <p>Explore the code and see if you can find the super secret password.</p>
        <form>
          <input id="input" type="text" placeholder="Enter super secret password"></input>
          <button id="enter" data-password="tacocat">Enter</button>
        </form>
      </p>
      <div class="hidden">
        <h2>Nice Job! 🎉</h2>
        <p>You found it! The source code contains all the things that make up this page, including the password. If you are building out a website, be sure not to include sensitive information in your code. People can still inspect it, even if it's not visible!</p>
