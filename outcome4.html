        <h1>Outcome: Expulsion</h1>
       <P> You use the password to raise your grade. However, the next day, you are called into the principal's office. Your teacher is there. The principal explains that you were caught cheating and unfairly raising your grade. You are expelled. It's tempting to do things that help us in the moment. However, the class is only one year, and you can retake a class. Getting expelled is permanent and takes away an opportunity to grow and learn. While it can be hard to make decisions, sometimes we have to think about long-term consequences of our actions. Let's try again and make some better decisions!  </P>
